WEATHERØR.NOT
============
WEATHERØR.NOT was created as part of General Assembly's Web Development Immersive 5-day Sprint on October 2014. (This project will continued to be worked on in the upcoming month of November 2014.)

WEATHERØR.NOT is a fun and concise weather application that will tell you the weather information you need just like apps such as Accuweather and YahooWeather. But unlike any other weather app, it will suggest what clothes you should wear to take on the current weather conditions.

When it comes to weather, people don’t always know what to wear when they leave the house to be comfortable. WEATHERØR.NOT is the solution to this problem. Gone are the days of wondering whether or not you should wear a jacket before you leave the house. 

Instructions: 
* Click arrow on splash page to enter site
* Users are able to look up weather by valid zipcodes and see corresponding weather on the hour, tomorrow's weather, and weekly weather.
* Users are able to see what clothes they should be wearing according to the weather outside.
* Users are able to create a profile and create their profile to get real-time updates. (In progress as of 10/30).

Technologies Utilized: Ruby on Rails, jQuery, jQuery UI, AJAX, Javascript, JSON, XML, HTML5, CSS 3, Bootstrap, WUnderground API, and Google Font API.
